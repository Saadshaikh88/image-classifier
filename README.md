# YOLO Image Classification Project
This project is a simple tool for image classification and object detection using YOLO and Python

## What does it do?
- Uses a pre-trained YOLOv5 model to detect your image.
- Shows the results with boxes drawn around detected objects.
- Prints details about what was found.
- Saves the results in a folder called `results/`.

## How to use

1. **Install the requirements:**
   - Python 3.x
   - Ultralytics YOLO:  
     `pip install ultralytics`
   - OpenCV:  
     `pip install opencv-python`
   - Tkinter (usually comes with Python on Windows)

2. **Run the script:**
   - Open a terminal in your project folder.
   - Run:  
     `python imageclassify.txt`
   - A window will pop upâ€”choose an image file (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`).

3. **See the results:**
   - The image will open with boxes around detected objects.
   - Results are printed in the terminal.
   - Annotated images are saved in the `results/` folder.

##   My Future ambition for this project

- Try training YOLO on your own images.
- More detailed detection of objects images
- Add live webcam detection.
- Make the GUI better
- Export results to a CSV file.
